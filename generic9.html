								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<br>
								<p align="justify">Protagonists are natural-born leaders, full of passion and charisma. Forming around two percent of the population. With a natural confidence that begets influence, Protagonists take a great deal of pride and joy in guiding others to work together to improve themselves and their community.</p>

								<h2>Protagonist Strengths</h2>
								<br>
								<ul>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Tolerant – </strong>Protagonists are true team players, and they recognize that that means listening to other peoples’ opinions, even when they contradict their own. They admit they don’t have all the answers, and are often receptive to dissent, so long as it remains constructive.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Reliable – </strong>The one thing that galls Protagonists the most is the idea of letting down a person or cause they believe in. If it’s possible, Protagonists can always be counted on to see it through.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Charismatic – </strong>Charm and popularity are qualities Protagonists have in spades. They instinctively know how to capture an audience, and pick up on mood and motivation in ways that allow them to communicate with reason, emotion, passion, restraint – whatever the situation calls for. Talented imitators, Protagonists are able to shift their tone and manner to reflect the needs of the audience, while still maintaining their own voice.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Altruistic – </strong>Uniting these qualities is Protagonists’ unyielding desire to do good in and for their communities, be it in their own home or the global stage. Warm and selfless, Protagonists genuinely believe that if they can just bring people together, they can do a world of good.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Natural Leaders – </strong>More than seeking authority themselves, Protagonists often end up in leadership roles at the request of others, cheered on by the many admirers of their strong personality and positive vision.</p></li>
									<br>
