								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<br>
								<p align="justify">My project would be an app on mobile phones base on AI technology that could help users learn new languages. This kind of app could be utilized for learning new vocabulary and studying how to pronounce it in the right way. Moreover, if the users pronounce a word incorrectly, this app also check and help them to improve from mistakes. In addition, there is not only English in this app but also all of the languages in the world that would appear on this app. Furthermore, if you want to learn more vocabulary this app has many lists of vocabulary for specific topics such as Halloween, Christmas or Independence Day or you can match with other users who are learning your languages and your language is their mother language. Finally, to make this app become more appealing to children, I also require some games that are the functions of support learning new languages.</p>

								<br>
								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<br>
								<p align="justify">In the evolved world, learning new languages has become more and more important in modern life. Thanks to the multinational trend of many companies in the world, learning new languages would be an advantage for employees who want to get a job, especially if they have to work in a country that only using mother languages. For example, approximately 75% of Japanese who in 20 - 50 years old cannot speak English. As a result, employees should require basic Japanese skills if they want to work in Japan. Moreover, it is also good for people who just want to enjoy their holiday abroad. For instance, if visitors get lost in Japan, they probably can ask anyone to show them how to get the right way.</p>

								<h2>Description</h2>
								<br>

								<br>
								<ul>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Choosing Languages: </strong>this feature will help the user can choose their mother language and the new languages that they want to learn. As a result, this app can easily translate from a new language to the users’ languages. Moreover, it is possible for the user to choose more than 1 languages and they can change the languages they have selected very easily.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Picture Learning: </strong>this feature can teach users the new vocabulary by a picture. To be more specific, they can take or upload a picture on this app, use their finger to circle what objects they want to translate. After that, the word of an object will appear on the screen. This kind of function could be very attractive to children because of their curious.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Definition and giving example: </strong>If users want to study a word more deeply, they can click on that word and they could see a definition and an example. In addition, they can try to make a sentence with that word on this app, and submit to check grammar and meaning. However, this feature has to be used online because it is linked with online dictionaries.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Checking errors: </strong>When the users want to know how to pronounce a word they have, they just have to click the speaker and this app will give them a transcribe and a 3D face that shows them how to move their mouth. In case that they pronounce incorrectly, this app will show where they have to improve by underlining and changing the color of that word base on how good they are (red: incorrect, yellow: normal, green: perfect).</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Studying by topics: </strong>If the users want to learn about big holidays or indigenous people’s daily life in the world, there would have a list with a several of topics for them to select and learn about. In this feature, there are not only new vocabularies which are related to a topic but also some common sentences that indigenous people usually use in communication. Of course that this kind of feature also based on the languages that the user has chosen before.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Studying by playing games: </strong>This feature is a result of combining learning and entertainment. This function could help the users feel more excited about studying new languages and it is also attractive children. Consequently, parents could encourage their children to learn new languages easier. In this feature, users also can choose the level of a game from beginner to advanced and each level will have some topic chapters. As a result, they would not feel bored when playing and they also can improve themselves after they enjoyed it.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Communicating with foreign people: </strong>Based on users’ mother languages and a language that they have chosen. This app could match them with other people who have an opposite selection with the users. As a consequence, they can communicate and learn more languages with each other by texting or calling video. If they feel that is a good match, they can add friend on this app and keep a relationship. However, if the users want to use this feature they also have a wifi connection.</p></li>

								<br>
								<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
								<br>
								<ul>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Software: </strong>This app would be available on mobile phones (Android +iOS. Therefore, I could use Java, Python, and Swift to make this app. Moreover, using Java and Python is also help me to develop the AI function on this app. Due to the fact that this app linked to online dictionaries, I would use HTML and CSS to link with those webs directly.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Hardware: </strong>To make this app, I do not need to use any special hardware. However, it is better for an experiment if having good RAM because this app has a lot of features so it could be slow if the RAM is nearly full.</p></li>
									<br>
								</ul>
								<br>

								<br>
								<h2>Skills Required</h2>
								<br>
								<ul>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Creative: </strong>One of the most important thing that an IT employee must have that is creative. If I do not have this skill, they could not develop their ideas and their jobs. As a result, those projects would be failed.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Patient: </strong>Doing this project, I would have to face a lot of pressure because of failures while working. However, if I could require this skill, I probably overcome all of that and continue to develop what I want to do and finish this project.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify"><strong>Good at Python, Java, and Swift: </strong>These programming languages are the foundations to make my project. Consequently, without this skill, I never finish it.</p></li>
									<br>
								</ul>

								<br>
								<h2>Outcome</h2>
								<br>
								<p align="justify">In the case that my project would be successful in the future, there are more and more people who can talk more than 1 or maybe 2 languages. As a result, the language barrier would not a problem in the world anymore. Moreover, people could get a Visa to travel, study, work and live more easily. In addition, the tourism and service industry would be very developed when people can get an abroad holiday easily. Finally, the creative industry could have a breakthrough in developing because of the combining of a lot of cultures in the world that could make many unpredictable products for this kind of industry.</p>
