								<h2>How do I improve my skills?</h2>
								<p align="justify">There are some ways which I can improve the job’s skills:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><p align="justify">Engaging in clubs and social activities is a good idea for me if I want to get a job (not only this position). Based on the type of club, I would have opportunities to improve my soft skills and become more enthusiastic. For example, if I participate in the RMIT Student Council, that I probably could improve management skills, communication skills, and teamwork skills because of the club’s environment. In addition, it is also a good way to improve my CV due to certifications.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify">Playing sports and having a suitable diet is necessary not only for me but also for everyone to have good health. If my health is bad, I could get sick very easily. Furthermore, it is really hard for me to focus on doing anything. Consequently, I would lose my dream job or maybe if it worse, I would never get a job.</p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify">Learning new things and reading is one of the best ways that I have chosen to improve my brain and creativity and this fact has proven by <a href =https://ccsuconed.wordpress.com/><font color="0000FF">ccsuconed.wordpress.com.</font></a></p></li>
									<br>
									<li><p align="justify">Doing an internship is commonly known as the best way to get experiences or if employees do well, they would be hired immediately by a company. In my opinion, it is totally true because if I cannot get a job immediately, at least I could require some skills that make you do your job more efficiently.</p></li>
